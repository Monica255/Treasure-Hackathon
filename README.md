# FOCA TEAM

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOCA stands for Food Caring. FOCA was made to solved food waste problem. based on [Food Waste - Harvard](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/sustainability/food-waste/), food waste refers to food that is fit for consumption but consciously discarded at the retail or consumption phases. Food waste has a bad impact to our environment because decomposing food waste produces methane, a strong greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. And not only that, in Worldwide, one-third of food produced is thrown away uneaten, causing an increased burden on the environment. But we can handle this problem by reducing food waste, from harvard.edu, It is estimated that reducing food waste by 15% could feed more than 25 million Americans every year.

# SOLUTION 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore we made FOCA, with FOCA people can find a leftover food to donate with a lower price of its original price. Not only for helping reduce food waste, FOCA also has a social impact that can help people who is starving. With FOCA, leftover food that already paid by someone to donate can be claim by any people free. By that we can give leftover foods to anyone and can help to reducing leftover food. Our main goal is to reduce food waste and help to improve our environment to be better.
