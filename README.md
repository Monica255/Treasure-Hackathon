# Treasure-Hackathon
This Application is supposed to have 3 kind of interfaces which are the one for contributors, users, and non-profit organization. If you're logged in as a 
contributor(a.k.a donatur) you will be able to purchase leftover foods to be claimed later by those in need. As a user, you can claim free leftover foods that have been
purchased by contributor or marked as free in the first place by seller. Lastly, as a non-profit organization, you will be notified by the system if there are massive 
amount of leftovers foods in a restaurants, store etc.
